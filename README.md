# Animated Bicycle Graphics – Turbo C++ Project

This project demonstrates a simple 2D bicycle animation built using the classic Turbo C++ graphics.h library.
It visually animates a moving cycle, wheels, road, and stone using primitive graphics functions like line(), circle(), and rectangle().

## 📌 Features

-Smooth bicycle animation using repetitive frame drawing
-Rotating wheels made using circle()
-Moving road and stone effects
-Uses Turbo C++ BGI graphics
-Simple, beginner-friendly animation logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-C++ (Turbo C++/Borland Compiler)
-graphics.h
-BGI Graphics Library

## ▶️ How It Works

-A loop redraws the bicycle frame at increasing x-coordinates.
-cleardevice() is used to erase the previous frame.
-Basic shapes like lines & circles create the bicycle animation.

## ❗ Notes

-This code only works on Turbo C++ or DOSBox because graphics.h is outdated.
-It will NOT run on modern compilers like GCC or OnlineGDB.
